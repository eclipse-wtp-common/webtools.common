        The ComponentCore API allows clients to work with the Structural 
        Metamodels that define abstract modules within Eclipse projects. 
        These metamodels are exposed through the Virtual Path API layer 
        (see <a href="ComponentCore.html">ComponentCore</a>). Clients 
        should also review the <b>org.eclipse.wst.common.componentcore.resources</b>
        package.

        <h2>ComponentCore Metamodel (CCM)</h2>
        <BR /> 
        <p>
            The ComponentCore Metamodel (CCM) is an EMF model that allows 
			the tooling to understand most project structures. Each project 
			has a single CCM which is stored under the project root named
            <I>.wtpmodules</I>
            . The XML format is defined by the 
            <a href="../../../../../overview/componentCore.xsd">ComponentCore schema</a>.
            The following diagram is a UML representation of the 
			ComponentCore Metamodel. This information is published for 
			potential contributors of editors, but the EMF model is 
			not exposed directly as API, and could change in view of 
			changes for WTP 1.1.

        <p>
            Each logical component contained in the project is represented by a
            <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> element. The <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> defines 
            information about the type of component, the resources consumed by the 
            module from the project, and the referenced components. The 
            <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> is very generic, and as modeled, does 
            not necessarily correspond to only J2EE artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> has a
            <i>name</i>
            , which is the name that will be used when the runtime form of the
            component is constructed. For a web application, the
            <i>name</i>
            might be "MyWebApplication".
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> may be uniquely referenced by a URI. The 
            fully qualified URI to any component must begin with the component
            protocol ("component:"), specify a subprotocol ("resource|classpath") and
            then a path to the referenced component. A <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> with the
            name "MyWebApplication" defined in a project named
            "MyWebModulesProject" would be referenced by the following URI:
            "component:/resource/MyWebModulesProject/MyWebApplication". As a future 
            extension, a component referenced on the classpath of a project (perhaps 
            a Utility Jar or an EJB Client Jar), the URI might be something like:
            "component:/classpath/MyWebModulesProject/CustomerEJBClient.jar". 
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> has a <b>ComponentType</b>. The 
            <b>ComponentType</b> defines a <i>componentTypeId</i>
            , which indicates the specific kind of component. The Web Tools Platform
            uses the <i>componentTypeId</i>
            to determine how to work with the content component of the <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>
            and prepare the component for deployment. The <b>ComponentType</b> may 
            also define the runtime-paths of special metadata resources which are 
            important to the <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>. "Metadata" refers to resources 
            which explain the content details of the specific modules. An example of 
            such a file would be the "WEB-INF/web.xml" deployment descriptor for 
            Web Applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> contains a list of ComponentResources. Each
            <b>ComponentResource</b> has "sourcePath" and a corresponding
            "runtimePath". The "sourcePath" can reference either a file or folder,
            but the referenced resource must be contained in the same project as the
            <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> definition. The "runtimePath" specifies a location
            relative to the deployed structure of the <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> where the
            contents of the referenced resource will be represented when the module is
            prepared for runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>WorkbenchComponent</b> contains a list of <b>ReferencedComponent</b>s. 
            Each <b>ReferencedComponent</b> provides a handle that must resolve to a 
            <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>, a runtimePath that defines where the constructed 
            component will be placed within the context of the runtime 
            <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>, and a <b>DependencyType</b>
            that can be either "consume" or "use" to indicate how the contents of
            that <b>ReferencedComponent</b> should be absorbed by the <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>.
            <b>ReferencedComponent</b>s may reference <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>s in 
            other projects and on current project's classpath (Not yet implemented). 
            The <b>DependencyType</b> will determine whether the contents of
            the <b>ReferencedComponent</b> are absorbed as-is or archived into a *.{w|j|e}ar
            file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>ProjectComponents</b> object provides a root container for all
            <b>WorkbenchComponent</b>s defined in a given project.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>ComponentCore</b> provides a facade to manage the underlying model for
            clients. Static methods
            <code>ModuleCore.getModuleCoreForRead()</code>
            and
            <code>ModuleCore.getModuleCoreForWrite()</code>
            may be used to acquire an ModuleCore adapter, and clients are responsible
            for invoking
            <code>dispose()</code>
            whenever they are finished using the model.
        </p>

        <h2>Constraints enforced by the CCM</h2>
        <p>
            The following constraints are enforced by the model:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The solution will not check dependencies for components that are
                        contained in the same project. To get the full benefits of
                        inter-component dependency checking, components must be separated
                        into different projects. We do not have the necessary
                        flexibility in constructing and scoping classpaths on a level
                        more granular than the project level, which would be needed
                        to support this functionality.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The solution will not allow a single component to span more than
                        one project. Within that project, we will have fairly broad
                        flexibility to specify which resources map to which components.
                        Each component within a project must have its own source folder,
                        but a component may contain more than one source folder. Each
                        source folder may be contained by at most one component. Components
                        may reference dependent components in other projects (so a Web
                        Application may reference a Web Library outside of the
                        project that contains the Web Application).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The solution will not allow more than one server target per
                        component (and really per-project) at a time. The ability to
                        switch this server target (via some action or property
                        setting) will continue to be possible. Users that need the
                        capability to develop for multiple server targets will need
                        to manually switch and test as necessary.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Each component in a project may have its own output folder
                        structure automatically constructed for it. The output
                        structure will match the J2EE specification output structure
                        required for the component type (for J2EE modules). A new
                        builder will handle this responsibility and work
                        cooperatively with the Java builder to construct a
                        deployable, on-disk representation of the module structure.
                        The reference implementation will follow this pattern, but 
                        hooks will be made available to vary this behavior.
                        The necessity for this on-disk structure to match a
                        J2EE-compliant layout is motivated by the requirement to have
                        in-workbench testing, so that users will not have to deal
                        with a deployer actually constructing a deployable module and
                        shipping it off to a server to test their code. This approach
                        is consistent with existing Ant-based approaches and
                        Application Servers which can run in a "debug" mode on disk.
                        Our value-add will be greater automation and integration with
                        the workbench -- particularly for incremental based support.
                        The specialized module builder would not be necessary if the
                        source was already in the appropriate J2EE specification
                        compliant structure. The default creation will still
                        encourage a single module per project, which conforms to the
                        correct J2EE structure.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Components will be described using a simple XML format, and each
                        project will contain one
                        <I>.wtpmodules</I>
                        file that will describe all of the components for that project.
                        The level of tooling to help users create these files is yet
                        to be determined for WTP M4. This would be a great area for
                        other interested developers to suggest and provide tooling
                        (e.g. a Wizard or Editor) to create these files from existing
                        structures. A schema is provided to make it easier for
                        consumers that want to build their own
                        <I>.wtpmodules</I>
                        by hand to take advantage of the content assist in the XML
                        editor.
