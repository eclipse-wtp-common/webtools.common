#     *************************************************************************
#     * Code oriented instructions:
#     *
#     * In the string, you may see the following special sequences:
#     * a) {n}  where n is a number. These are replaceable parameters.
#     * b) ''  In .properties files, in order to see one apostrophe (') in the final
#     *    string, sometimes two apostrophes must be entered in the string. In the translated
#     *    string, if there is at least one {n} in the string, then to show one apostrophe
#     *    to the user, put two apostrophes in the string. If there are no {n} in the string,
#     *    then put one apostrophe.
#     *    For example, say that you want the user to read "George's file". 
#     *        GEORGE=George's file was on the desk.
#     *        GEORGE2=George''s file and {0} were on the desk.
#     *    GEORGE uses one apostrophe because there are no {n} and GEORGE2
#     *    uses two apostrophes because there is a {n}.
#     * c) '' text '' where text can be any word(s). The text between the double
#     *    apostrophes should not be translated. 
#     * d) <text> where text can be any word(s). The text between the angle
#     *    brackets should NOT be translated.
#     * e) "text" where text can be any word(s). The text between the quotation 
#     *    marks should NOT be translated.
#     *    
#     *************************************************************************
#     * Other instructions
#     * a) Do not translate any text that is on a line which begins with a comment 
#     *    symbol (#).
#     * b) Do not translate these words: 
#     *        schema, EJB, RDB, JAR, RMI, BMP, CMP, OOSQL
#     * c) Please return the .properties files using the same directory structure.
#     *    This is necessary because two of the files have the same name.
#     *

VBF_EXC_CANNOT_ADD_MARKER=IWAE0001E The marker cannot be added to resource {0} in the task list.
VBF_EXC_CANNOT_REMOVE_MARKER=IWAE0002E The marker cannot be removed from resource {0} in the task list.

VBF_EXC_HELPER_MISSING=IWAE0003E Unable to load {0} because it did not specify a <helper>. Each validator must identify the helper class that loads its MOF model.
VBF_EXC_HELPER_CANNOTLOAD=IWAE0004E Unable to load {0} because its <helper>, {1}, could not be loaded. Ensure that the case-sensitive file name is spelled correctly.

VBF_EXC_INTERNAL=IWAE0005E An internal error occurred during validation. Validation was being run on project {0} with validator {1}. The message thrown was {2}.

# 2TC: In the following string, "type" is a noun
VBF_EXC_INVALID_TYPE_FILTER=IWAE0006E Invalid type filter; {0} must be an instance of {1}.
VBF_EXC_INVALID_RESOURCE=IWAE0007E Cannot add message "{0}" with target object "{1}" because no file, folder, or project can be found with which to associate the message.

VBF_EXC_MISSING_VALIDATOR_EP=IWAE0008E The validator framework could not be started. The extension point named \"{0}\" could not be found. Save all log files and contact your IBM representative.
VBF_EXC_MISSING_PROJECTNATURE_ID=IWAE0009E A projectNature must have an associated ID. Validation is ignoring this tag and continuing.

VBF_EXC_RUNTIME=IWAE0010E Run-time exception {0} occurred during validation. The validator being run was {1} and the message thrown was {2}.

VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NULL_NAME=IWAE0011E Resource {0} cannot be added to file list because IHelper.getPortableName() returns null. This resource will not be validated by the validator named {1}.
VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NO_HELPER=IWAE0012E No <helper> element is specified in the plugin.xml file for validator {0}. Since the helper cannot be created, the validator will not be loaded.
VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NO_HELPER_CLASS=IWAE0013E No "class" attribute in the <helper> element is specified in the plugin.xml file for validator {0}. The helper cannot be created without the name of the class that implements it. Since the helper cannot be created, the validator will not be loaded.
VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NO_HELPER_THROWABLE=IWAE0014E The helper {0} cannot be created because a Throwable was caught.
VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NO_VAL_RUN=IWAE0015E Validator cannot be created because no <run> element is specified in the plugin.xml file for the validator named {0}. Cannot create a validator unless a <run> element exists that specifies the "class" attribute. The value of the "class" attribute should be the name of the class that implements the IWorkbenchHelper interface.
VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NO_VAL_CLASS=IWAE0016E Validator cannot be created because no "class" attribute is specified in the <run> element of the plugin.xml file for the validator named {0}. Cannot create a validator unless a <run> element exists that specifies the "class" attribute. The value of the "class" attribute should be the name of the class that implements the IWorkbenchHelper interface.
VBF_EXC_SYNTAX_NO_VAL_THROWABLE=IWAE0017E Cannot create validator {0} because a Throwable was caught.
